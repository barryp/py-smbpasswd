CHANGELOG

v1.0.2
-------------

    Slight changes to the packaging only, for 
    submission to PyPi.  Basically wanted the 
    tgz file to extract to smbpasswd-x.x.x instead
    of py-smbpasswd-x.x.x

    The actual Python and C code for the library
    has not changed one bit.  The setup.py just
    changed slightly for a version number bump
    and some additional trove classifiers.

v1.0.1
-------------

   Cleaned up two minor compile warnings

   Clarified the licensing notices - this is 
   GPLed because Samba is.

   Otherwise, no change in behavior at all 
   from version 1.0
